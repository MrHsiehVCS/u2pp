## Important Information

Now that you know how to use if statements, loops, user input, output, and classes/inheritance, you can make literally any game that has ever existed!

So, make something you think is cool!

Pick an idea that you are _personally_ interested in.

It's _much, much_ more fun to pick something hard that you like, instead of picking something easy that just hits the requirements. You will also learn more that way :)

If it's something super ambitious, you can spend multiple projects working on different aspects of it. For example, if you want to recreate Pokémon, you might spend this unit working on something that displays different Pokémon stats/moves, and allows the user to build a roster. Then, next unit you might start working on the combat, etc. Talk to Mr. Hsieh about it!

## Requirements

### Things you have to produce

* A program that
  * does something cool
  * is easy to use (user interface is clear. Someone who knows nothing about your program does not get confused while using it.)
  * has no bugs
* source code that is easy to understand
  * include comments where appropriate
* A readme that:
  * explains the purpose/functionality of your program
  * explains how to start your program

### Requirements you should design for

* 1+ superclasses
* 2+ subclasses
* 1+ instance of overloading
* 1+ instance of overriding (you are allowed to override `toString()`)
* Takes in user input through the console using the `Scanner` class
* Does something cool :)

### Requirements that will probably be automatically met as you work

* 1+ instance of an if statement
* 1+ instance of a loop

## Grading

Your grade will be scaled based on how ambitious your project was (easier to achieve high grades with a hard project, cannot achieve an A with a very simple project).

You will be graded on

1. Functionality
    * does it do what intended
    * how buggy is it? Mr. Hsieh will try his best to break your code :)  
1. Source Code Readability
    * Please have comments at the top of each class explaining its purpose
    * please have comments explaining any function that isn't super short
    * please have comments explaining any code where you felt like you did something janky/hacky
1. Meeting all the Requirements
    * Make sure you don't miss _any_ of them!
